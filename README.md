# MemoDOC
Small cli program for memorizing and outputting specific commands very quickly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install memodoc -g
```

## Description

This small cli program is designed for developers in study or who have just arrived in a company.
The idea came to me in the second year of studying computer science. During an Angular pratique work.
I was wasting a lot of time looking for the exact syntax of the "ns" utility commands.

With this small program you can find with a small command your most complex syntaxes quickly.
The add of command is also done very quickly.
